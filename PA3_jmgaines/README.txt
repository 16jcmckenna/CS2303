Jonathan Gaines
PA3

Summary:
		This program counts total number of words, number of unique words, amount of
	an individual word, and sorts all the words in the document alphabetically. 

To Run:
	./PA3 <output file> <input1 file> ...

	As many input files as you would like to insert can be inserted.

	EX1: ./PA3 output.txt input1.txt input2.txt input3.txt
	EX2: ./PA3 output.txt input1.txt

Development Problems:
		A problem I encountered was relating to the lack of variable initialization 
	after allocation of memory for my tree node. I fixed this by giving an initial
	value to the elements of my structure.
